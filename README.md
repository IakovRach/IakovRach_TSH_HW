# TSH Test Data Conversion
##Description
This program opens the test_data.txt file and reads in the information from the patients. It then creates
dictionaries for each patient that can display the name, age, sex, TSH scores and diagnosis of the patient.
##How to use:
In order to run the program you can call the tsh_diagnosis.py file. It will ask you to enter the patient number
of the patient you are interested in and display the attributes as well as the diagnosis for this patient. Additionally, it will store this information in a .json file named with the patient's firstname_lastname.jsonOA
